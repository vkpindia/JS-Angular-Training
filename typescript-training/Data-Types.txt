1. Typescript is strongly typed language

2. types are used by typescript compiler to checking and enabling 
developrs to check correct values are passed to a variable

3. We can specify the types(Data type) of the variable at the 
time of creating varibales in the program

* Typescript supports following predefined types:

Number
String
Boolean
Date
Object
Array
Tupple
Void
Unknown
Enum
any



Basically Two type of data type avaialable:

1. Premitive types -> Number, String, Void, Unknown etc. 
2. Non-premitive types -> Array, Tupple, Object etc.


Declaring the variables in Functional Typescript Programming:

--> Every programming languages supports variables in order to store
and access the values

--> Typescript also supports varibales to process the data

--> We use let, var and const keywords to declare the variable in 
functional TypeScript programming



Syntax:

keywords_name variable_name: data_type;

keywords_name variable_name: data_type = value;


Example: 

var sid: number;
let sname: string;
const age = 20;


Note: If you will not declare variable without type in TS then the 
the compiler consider as 'any' type

'any' type variable can store all the types of data.
