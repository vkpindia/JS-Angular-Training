Object Oriented Programming in TypeScript:
__________________________________________

1. Object oriented programming(OOP) Systemsrefers to type 
of programming in which programmers defines the data and
its operartions

2. In OOP, class defines variables(fields) and its functions
(methods) in single unite.

3. We can create object by using class


What are the principles of OOPS?:
_________________________________

1. Every object oriented programming languages should support
the following fundamental principles=>

* Abstraction ==> Object
* Inheritance ==> Reusibility
* Polymorphism ==> Overloading and over-riding
* Encapsulation ==> class


2. Example of OOP languages:

c++, JAVA, c#, TypeScript, Python etc.


What are the advantage of OOP:
_________________________________

Modularity
Reusibility
Data Security
Data Binding



Implementing OOP in TypeScript:
_________________________________

-> TypeScript Also is a OOP language
-> TS supports all the OOP concepts like classes, Object
constrcutor, Inheritance and Interface etc.


Creating a class in TS:
_________________________________

-> class keyword is used to declar a class

Syntax:

class class_name {
   // we wraps fields(variables) and methods 
}

Note: class names are starts with capital letters and next word also will start with capital letter

Exa:

class Student {
    public sid: number = 1025;
    public sname: tsring = 'scott';

    printData(): void {
        // Method body
    }
}


Rules that we should follow in TS OOP:
__________________________________________

1. Don't use var, let or const keywords to declare 
class properties(variables, fields)
2. Don't function keywords to declare methods in class
3. use 'this' keyword to access properties in the class.
4. Each member in class is declared as public by default.
