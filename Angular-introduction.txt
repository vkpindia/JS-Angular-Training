Angular
_______________


Angular is a framework for developing web application and 
mobile applications. It is developed by Google Team.

* We use typescript scriptiong lagunage to write the code in 
angular framewrok
* This is a Component based promming framwork
* Angular follows three types of design pattern

1. MVVM
2. Moduler
3. Singleton

* Current version of angular is Agular@13.1.3

For mobile app development we use third party plateforms
1. Cordova
2. IONIC Framwork-> This runs on top of Angulak Framwork


Design Pattern:
1. MVVM -> Model-view -> view Model


Framework = Plateform + Runtime(Node js)


In React-> 

For http call->  Axios
State managemnet->  Redux
UI Library-> Third party
---- Promises
it uses the JS


In Angular->  

1. It has its own Runtime environment
2. Its has built in CLI for project manipulation
3. For http calls--->  HttpCliendModule
4. UI Library-> Angular Material
5. State management-> NGRX
6. Asynchronous->  RXJS
7. Observables
8. It use Typescript
